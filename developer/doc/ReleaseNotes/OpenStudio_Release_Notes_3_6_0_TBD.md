# Overview

As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.6.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

OpenStudio SDK 3.6.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 22.1.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v22.1.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. It is no longer necessary to download and install EnergyPlus separately. Other builds of EnergyPlus are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.6.0.

OpenStudio SDK 3.6.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. Other builds of Radiance are not supported by OpenStudio SDK 3.6.0.

As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-SDK-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.


## Installation Steps

- Download and install [OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio) and/or [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2021-2022 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply re-run the OpenStudio Application installer.

## New Features, Major Fixes and API-breaking changes

* Support Ubuntu 22.04 and remove 18.04
* [#4778](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4778) - Wrap AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl and AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl:HR
    * `ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow` has API-breaking changes related to setters and getters for its heating and cooling coils. They now use `HVACComponent` instead of the more restrictive `CoilHeatingDXVariableRefrigerantFlow` and `CoilCoolingDXVariableRefrigerantFlow`.
    * `AirConditionerVariableRefrigerantFlow::clone` was changed to stop cloning the child `Curve` objects (20 of them)

* [#4740](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4740) - Fix issues around `ScheduleFixedInterval`, with A minor API breaking change: `intervalLength`/`setIntervalLength` now return/accept an `int` rather than a `double` to conform to the IDD type `\integer`

* [#4813](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4813) - Wrap `SolarCollectorPerformance:PhotovoltaicThermal:BIPVT`
    * `SolarCollectorFlatPlatePhotovoltaicThermal` has API-breaking changes in the `solarCollectorPerformance` getter due to the addition of this new object: it used to return a `SolarCollectorPerformancePhotovoltaicThermalSimple` (the only performance object at the time), now it's a `ModelObject`.

## Minor changes and bug fixes


* [#4828](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/pull/4828) - Fix Space load-based actuator for spaces are named based on thermal zone name
    * As part of this PR, the optional field at the end `Zone Name` is replaced with `Zone or Space` and some API changes are there around it. The only minor breaking one is that `boost::optional<ModelObject> zoneName()` (deprecated) will now return either a Zone or a Space. Before if you called setSpace it would store the space's ThermalZone, now it stores the Space itself. This is unlikely to affect most users.
